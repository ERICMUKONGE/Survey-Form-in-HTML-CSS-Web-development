Using HTML and CSS to create a survey form is a fantastic way to practice web development.
Structure of HTML:
Name, email, age, gender, rating, and feedback are among the details gathered by the form.
For accessibility, it has label tags; every input has a label attached to it.
Prior to submission, the needed property guarantees that all necessary fields (such as name and email) are completed.
CSS Design:
Layout: To give the form a card-like look, the.container div centers it with padding and a box shadow.
Form Elements: The form is more aesthetically pleasing when the inputs, radio buttons, and dropdowns are styled.
Button: To improve interactivity, the submit button incorporates a hover effect.
This configuration provides you with a simple, useful HTML and CSS survey form.
